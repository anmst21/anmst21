# Anthony Nazarov

Frontend engineer in NYC. I build clear, fast interfaces for web and mobile — focused on React, TypeScript, and Next.js.

Over the past few years I've shipped products across Web3, AI, and consumer apps — from cross-chain trading platforms to mobile-first NFT tools to AI marketing sites. I care about performance, polish, and reducing friction between intent and action.
